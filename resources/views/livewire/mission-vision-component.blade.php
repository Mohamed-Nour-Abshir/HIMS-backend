					<h3>Chairman Message</h3>
					<p>Welcome to BIMDUR, where excellence is nurtured, pursued, and celebrated. I am proud to have become the Chairman of this institute. From its establishment in 2012, over the years, BIMDUR has increased many folds in every respect but there is no limit to improvements and advancement. As a Chairman my foremost tasks is to find weaknesses we have as an institution and identify the challenges facing us. Once we shall identify those we can strive to overcome them and mark our place as the best training institution in the country in the coming years. We really want to transform BIMDUR as a lavish garden of knowledge, producing outstanding postgraduates and undertaking relevant research recognized nationally and internationally. I hope we shall be able to work on this journey of excellence, placing BIMDUR among top ranked institutions. Our 5,000-plus students are engaged in ultrasonography as a sinologist in country and abroad. Whether you join us from across the campus, or from the other side of the world, I am proud to welcome you to our BIMDUR Family. Dr. M.A Muqueet MRCP, FACC, FESC</p>
